# svg-shikyotaira
SVG, HTML, CSS for my IGN logo, intended for gaming media platforms like [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/). "Shikyotaira" font based off Final Fantasy font type. Crossbow and bat are symbols of League of Legend's [Vayne](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Vayne). [shikyotaira](na.op.gg/summoner/userName=shikyotaira) is my IGN for League of Legends.


### Warnings
* Links are local to the server hierarchy, not the current hierarchy. Upon fork or clone all links will be broken.
* SVG and AI files are included so you may simply extract the SVG instead of working with the HTML file.
* CSS that affects only the SVG are located in shikyo.css. Other CSS files included for site.
* Fonts are not included in this repository.
* SVG code is long due to the bush stroke. You may want to delete the bush stroke from the AI file and re-export.
